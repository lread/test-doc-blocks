== Audience
You are someone who wants to verify that the Clojure/ClojureScript code examples in your docs work as expected.

== Prerequisites
Test generation requires Clojure v1.9 or above.

Generated tests can be run on Clojure v1.8 and above (if supported by your test runner).

You'll use your test runner of choice, for example: https://github.com/cognitect-labs/test-runner[Clojure test-runner], https://github.com/Olical/cljs-test-runner[cljs-test-runner] or https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha].

== Introduction
Test-doc-blocks might (or might not, see link:#limitations[limitations], and link:#interesting-alternatives[interesting alternatives]) be of interest for your Clojure/ClojureScript project.

Test-doc-blocks recognizes:

* CommonMark code blocks found in docstrings, `.md` files and `.adoc` files.
* AsciiDoc code blocks found in `.adoc` files.

An AsciiDoc code block looks like this:
[source,asciidoctor]
....
[source,clojure]
----
;; Some valid Clojure code here.
----
....

A CommonMark (sometimes also referred to as GitHub Markdown) code block looks like this:
[source,markdown]
....
```Clojure
;; Some valid Clojure code here.
```
....

If the code in your code blocks are REPL style:

//#:test-doc-blocks{:skip false}
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (* 6 7)
42
----

Or editor style:

//#:test-doc-blocks{:skip false}
[source,clojure]
----
(* 6 7)
;; => 42
----

And don't rely on any special unspecified setup, then test-doc-blocks will generate tests that verify that, yes, indeed:

`(* 6 7)` evaluates to `42`.

== Usage
Add an alias to your `deps.edn`:

// NOTE: mvn/version version is automatically updated by the release process
[source,clojure]
----
    :gen-doc-tests {:extra-deps {com.github.lread/test-doc-blocks {:mvn/version "1.0.146-alpha"}}
                    :exec-fn lread.test-doc-blocks/gen-tests}
----

The most basic usage is:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -X:gen-doc-tests
----

This generates Clojure tests for code blocks in your `README.md` file to the `target/test-doc-blocks/test` directory.
Any existing tests under `target/test-doc-blocks` will be replaced.

The generated tests have no dependency on test-doc-blocks.
You can run them with your preferred test runner.

Test-doc-blocks looks for assertions in your doc code blocks that are in editor style and REPL style format.
For example...

//#:test-doc-blocks{:skip false}
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (/ 714 17)
42
----

...generates the test assertion `(is (= 42 (/ 714 17)))`.

=== Detailed Examples with Inline Options

For detailed examples and inline options:

* link:example.adoc[AsciiDoc example]
* link:example.md[CommonMark example]
* link:example.cljc[Clojure source docstring example]

=== deps.edn Examples

The test-doc-blocks link:/deps.edn[deps.edn] has some aliases that might serve as useful examples:

* `:isolated/cljs-test-runner` - runs generated tests under ClojureScript using https://github.com/Olical/cljs-test-runner[cljs-test-runner] +
Invoke for this project via: `clj -M:isolated/cljs-test-runner`
* `:isolated/kaocha` - runs generated tests under Clojure using https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha] +
Invoke for this project via: `clj -M:isolated/kaoacha generated`. Note also kaocha link:/tests.edn[tests.edn] config which tells koacha to run tests in order (rather than randomized order).
* `:isolated/clj-test-runner` - runs generated tests under Clojure using https://github.com/cognitect-labs/test-runner[Cognitect test-runner] +
Invoke for this project via: `clj -M:isolated/clj-test-runner`

[#command-line-options]
=== Command Line Options

:docs::
By default, tests are generated for `README.md` only.
+
If you want to specify a different vector of files you can do so via `:docs`:
+
[source,shell]
----
clojure -X:gen-doc-tests :docs '["README.adoc" "doc/example.adoc" "doc/example.md" "doc/example.cljc"]'
----
+
`:docs` understands https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)[glob syntax].

:target-root::
The default directory where tests are generated is `./target`.
+
You can override this via `:target-root`:
+
[source,shell]
----
clojure -X:gen-doc-tests :target-root '"./someplace/else"'
----
+
Note that test-doc-blocks will delete and recreate the `test-docs-block/test` dir under the target root.
Keep the target location in mind when figuring out where to point your test runner.

:platform::
The platform governs what Clojure file types test-doc-blocks generates for tests.
+
Specify:

* `:clj` for Clojure, generates `.clj` files
* `:cljs` for ClojureScript, generates `.cljs` files
* `:cljc` for mixed, generates `.cljc` files

+
The default is `:cljc`.
You can override the platform for code blocks via inline options. +
Test-doc-blocks makes no platform assumptions when generating tests from doc blocks found in Clojure source files. Specify what makes sense for your tests.

TIP: Windows users: trying to escape -X args on the command line can lead to frustration.
Consider instead specifying options under `:exec-args` in your `:gen-doc-tests` alias in `deps.edn`.

[#limitations]
== Limitations

Some limitations that we might entertain addressing:

* If your code block depends on some external setup, we've no way to express that.
* Test-doc-blocks will automatically handle inline `(require ...)` and `(import ...)` appearing in code blocks, but not in any complex expressions of these forms.
* Parsing adoc and md files is on the naive side but should handle most common cases.
If we've overlooked a common syntax, let us know.

Some limitations we have no current plans to address:

* Code blocks using `ns` or `in-ns` will not work with test-doc-blocks. +
* For REPL style code blocks, we only look for `user=>` prompts and no other ns prompts.
* It is possible to embed HTML into your docs.
If you express code or headings in embedded HTML within your doc, test-doc-blocks won't find them.

[#interesting-alternatives]
== Interesting Alternatives

Other options and related projects that I am currently aware of:

* [.line-through]#https://github.com/seancorfield/readme[readme]# (archived) - Generates tests for code blocks found in .md files and then runs them.
This project was the inspiration for test-doc-blocks.
It is simpler but but also has less features.
* https://github.com/liquidz/testdoc[testdoc] - Tests code blocks in docstrings and external docs.
* https://github.com/sogaiu/alc.x-as-tests[alc.x-as-tests] - Runs code in `(comment ...)` blocks as tests.
* https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha] - Kaocha supports running Cucumber tests.
It uses this support in tests for some of its documentation.
A `.feature` document describes the feature and includes given, when, then scenarios that are both run and shown in the documentation.
You can use step definitions to hide any gritty details.
* https://github.com/holyjak/clj-concordion[clj-concordian] - Concordian seems like a relative of Cucumber.
It focuses on "Specification by Example".
* https://github.com/pink-gorilla/notebook[notebook] - Some day notebook type tools might serve both as tests and docs.
Until that golden day, test-doc-blocks and the above tools are worthy of consideration.
