Test AsciiDoc and CommonMark code blocks found in articles and docstrings

[CAUTION]
====
Sample code in docs, while likely not malicious, could be illustrating, for example, how to wipe a drive.
So, do be deliberate and careful about what docs you run through test-doc-blocks.

== Status

Alpha - early adopters and feedback welcome!

== Rationale
I wanted to make sure the code examples I provided in rewrite-clj v1 documentation do not mislead and do function as expected for those who dare to try them.
You might want the same for your library.

== Docs

* link:doc/01-user-guide.adoc[User Guide]
* link:doc/02-developer-guide.adoc[Developer Guide]

== Used to Test Docs In...

* https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql[honeysql] - Turn Clojure data structures into SQL
* https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj[rewrite-clj] - Rewrite Clojure Code and EDN!
* test-doc-blocks - Test AsciiDoc and CommonMark code blocks found in articles and docstrings _(meta, right?)_

Have an update? Let us know!

== Versioning

Test-doc-block versioning scheme is: `major`.`minor`.`patch`-`test-qualifier`

* `major` increments when the API has been broken - something, as a rule, we'd like to avoid.
* `minor` increments to convey significant new features have been added.
* `patch` indicates bug fixes - it is the number of commits in the repo.
* `test-qualifier` is absent for stable releases. Can be `alpha`, `beta`, `rc1`, etc.
